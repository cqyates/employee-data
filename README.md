# employee data

This is an early attempt at Javascript logic and dom manipulation. I remember being scared of the math and logic involved in javascript.  It looks like this is an example of my growing understanding of bootstrap and design, as well as basic dom manipulation.  I looks like I did not complete the portion of the task that calculated the years.  If I was going back and fixing it, I would use javascript's Date.now or Dayjs to calculate the number of months worked from today and then mulitply that number by the going rate to get the total.
